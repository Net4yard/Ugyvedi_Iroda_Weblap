                            <p>I have been a member of the Budapest Bar Association since 1991 and from later on, the
                                Pest
                                County Bar
                                Association. In addition to my legal practice, I am a university lecturer at the
                                Ludovika
                                University of
                                Public Service.
                                In addition to my academic and teaching career, it has always been important for me to
                                prove
                                myself not
                                only in the “ivory tower” of science but also in the practice of law. Therefore, I have
                                not
                                abandoned
                                the practice of law, and I have been practicing as a lawyer for the past 35 years.
                                As a university lecturer, I initially taught criminal law for four years, then later
                                administrative law
                                and constitutional law. I have been able to make good use of my academic specialisation
                                in
                                political
                                science—with a focus on public administration and economic governance—in public law

                                a lawyer. However, I have also remained faithful to criminal law.
                                In the scope of my legal activity, I represent my clients (individuals and legal
                                entities) in
                                litigation
                                and in out-of-court proceedings, also, in administrative procedures, offer legal
                                assistance and

                    <h4>Studies</h4>
                    <img src="images/office.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>I graduated as a doctor of law from the Faculty of Law of the Eötvös Loránd University in 1984
                        and received my PhD degree in 1997. I qualified as a lawyer in 1991, and since then, I have been
                        a member of the Budapest Bar Association and from later on, the Pest County Bar Association. My
                        experience as a lawyer has also helped me to develop my teaching and research activities.</p>
                    <h4>Education</h4>
                    <p>After graduating from law school, I taught at the Department of Criminal Justice at the Faculty
                        of Law of the University of Miskolc as an assistant professor until 1988, and since then, I have
                        been teaching at the Faculty of Public Governance and International Studies of the Ludovika
                        University of Public Service and its predecessors, the College of Public Administration and the
                        Corvinus University of Budapest. In 2009, I obtained a habilitated doctoral title at the Faculty
                        of Law of the University of Pécs, and in 2015, I was appointed professor at the Ludovika
                        University of Public Service.</p>
                    <h4>Study trips</h4>
                    <p>In the 1990s, I took part in study visits to Strasbourg, Florence, and Salzburg, focusing on
                        comparative law, European integration, and the American public law system. In 1998, I was a
                        Fulbright Visiting Scholar at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in the
                        United States, where I taught and researched legal and organisational issues in privatisation
                        and healthcare. </p>
                    <h4>Research</h4>
                    <p>I have also been involved in research at several American and European institutions over the last
                        three decades. The most important of these have been as follows: American Society for Public
                        Administration, American National Forum Foundation, The Network of Institutes and Schools of
                        Public Administration in Central and Eastern Europe, Open Society Institute: Local Government
                        and Public Service Initiative, Constitutional and Legislative Policy, Commission of the European
                        Communities. This research has focused on competition supervision in the public sector, the
                        organisation of public services, welfare reforms, privatisation, liberalisation, and public
                        management. </p>

                <div class="col-50">
                    <h4>Consultant</h4>
                    <p>In 1997, I was a legal adviser to the World Bank Project Management Unit in Hungary, working on
                        the Hungarian healthcare reform attempt. In 1999, in the Ministry of Health, I was involved in
                        the preparation of legislation on the privatisation of primary healthcare and then specialised
                        care. In 2013, I worked as an academic adviser at the NATO COE-DAT Ankara office, dealing with
                        international legal issues of migration and terrorism. </p>
                    <h4>Previous assignments</h4>
                    <p>As a lawyer, I have received assignments from the Hungarian Medical Chamber, the Chamber of
                        Pharmacists, the Municipality of Budapest, the Municipality of Pest County, the Ministry of
                        Social and Family Affairs, Telenor PLC, the Corvinus University Foundation, in legislative
                        matters and in the development of the legal background of e-Government. I was assigned by public
                        authorities to act as a legal representative in proceedings before the Constitutional Court in
                        connection with the constitutional supervision of legislation. I have been involved as a
                        researcher in the legal deregulation programme organised by the Prime Minister’s Office and in
                        the State Audit Office of Hungary’s research on state corruption. </p>

                    <h4>Memberships</h4>
                    <p>I was an elected member of the Pest County Election Committee in 2006 and an alternate member of
                        the National Election Committee between 2018 and 2022. I am the chair of the European Union Law
                        Department of the Hungarian Lawyers Association. I work with several Hungarian and international
                        academic law journals as a member of the editorial board, acting as a lector.</p>
